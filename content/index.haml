%h2 What burger?
%p
  When my favourite London burger vendor, Burger Bear, announced he was raising money on Kickstarter to open a restaurant, I knew I had to back him.  After reviewing the pledges, I decided to back the Â£1000 for 1000 burgers pledge.  But I can't eat 1000 burgers on my own, so now I plan to
  %a{:href => "/i-just-bought-1000-burgers"}
    swap them with the London startup community for their stories.

%h2 Want one of my 1000 burgers?
%p
  Well if you have an interesting story to share,
  %a{:href => "/i-want-a-burger"}
    you can probably have one.
